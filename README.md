# website-clone--facebook
This is a simple front-end clone of the Facebook homepage built using HTML and CSS. It replicates the core layout and design of Facebook, including the navigation bar, profile section, post area, sidebar, and footer. The project is fully responsive and styled with custom CSS to match the original look and feel of Facebook.
